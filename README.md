# Valentine Envelope Site

This project is a shareable Valentine page with an envelope animation sequence:

1. Tap envelope
2. Seal disappears (broken)
3. Flap opens and hearts float up
4. Letter slides out
5. Card opens like a book
6. Message types out
7. Signature appears: **From Jerald**

When closed, the card and letter are hidden so only the envelope is visible.
